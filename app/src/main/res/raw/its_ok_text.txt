Keep me here
My heart is near
My love has gone a-way

Tell me true
My heart is new
My love has gone a-way

It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you

Speak to me
My heart is free
My love has gone a-way

Tell me true
My heart is blue
My love has gone a-way

It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you

It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you

It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
